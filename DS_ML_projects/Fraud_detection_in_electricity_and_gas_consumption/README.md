# Fraud Detection Using Client Billing History

## Overview
**Title:** Fraud Detection in Client Billing History

**Overview:** The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.
Using the client’s billing history, the aim of the challenge is to detect and recognize clients involved in fraudulent activities.
The solution will enhance the company’s revenues and reduce the losses caused by such fraudulent activities..

## Aim
The goal of the project is to:

1. Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure data consistency and quality.
2. Engineer meaningful features from the given data, including consumption patterns, net consumption, and cluster-based insights.
3. Explore the data and identify trends or anomalies associated with fraudulent behavior.
4. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict fraud.
5. Assess model performance using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the primary metric.

## Technologies Used

### Python
Utilizing Python for:
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and transformations
- Training and evaluating machine learning models

### Machine Learning Models
Exploring and implementing various algorithms, including:
- Random Forest Classifier for baseline performance
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for enhanced predictive capabilities

### Libraries
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the ANN model
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to detect fraudulent activities in client billing systems. By leveraging machine learning models and advanced feature engineering, it aims to provide a robust solution for fraud detection.
