## Predicting Financial Inclusion in Africa

### Overview

#### *Title*: Financial Inclusion in Africa

*Overview*:  Financial inclusion is a significant issue in many developing countries, especially in Africa. Having access to a bank account can help individuals improve their financial stability. This project attempts to predict the likelihood of an individual having a bank account using various features such as age, location, education level, employment status, and more.

#### Aim:
The goal of the project is to:

Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Explore the data and understand key features related to bank account ownership.
Build and evaluate machine learning models for the prediction.
Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics.

### Technologies used
- #### Python: 
Leveraging Python for data pre-processing, feature engineering and building machine learning models 
- #### Machine Learning models:
Exploring and implementing various machine learning algorithms inclusing regression models to predict whether a person has a bank account or not
